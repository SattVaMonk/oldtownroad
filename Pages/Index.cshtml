    Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road<br>
    I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more<br>

    I got the horses in the back<br>
    Horse tack is attached<br>
    Hat is matte black<br>
    Got the boots that's black to match<br>
    Ridin' on a horse, ha<br>
    You can whip your Porsche<br>
    I been in the valley<br>
    You ain't been up off that porch, now<br>
    <br>
    Can't nobody tell me nothin'<br>
    You can't tell me nothin'<br>
    Can't nobody tell me nothin'<br>
    You can't tell me nothin'<br>
    <br>
    Ridin' on a tractor<br>
    Lean all in my bladder<br>
    Cheated on my baby<br>
    You can go and ask her<br>
    My life is a movie<br>
    Bull ridin' and boobies<br>
    Cowboy hat from Gucci<br>
    Wrangler on my booty<br>
    <br>
    Can't nobody tell me nothin'<br>
    You can't tell me nothin'<br>
    Can't nobody tell me nothin'<br>
    You can't tell me nothin'<br>

    I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road<br>
    I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more<br>
    <br>
    Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rock star<br>
    Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar<br>
    Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras<br>
    Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car<br>
    Got no stress, I've been through all that<br>
    I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back<br>
    Wish I could roll on back to that old town road<br>
    I wanna ride 'til I can't no more<br>
    <br>
    Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road<br>
    I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more<br>
    I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road<br>
    I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more<br>
